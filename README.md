## Part 2

For my part 2, I created an application for Chris that will allow him to enter the menu and view the menu in the home screen. I used one screen for this and made the app to look like my design above. Christoffel is private chef and is looking for an application.

When the app is running, Chris will see a header stating Add menu. The are 4 text inputs and one TouchableHighlight. Below that, the is a two headers one stating  Home and the other one menu: 0.

The chef will need to fill in the 4 text inputs, name, description, select course and price. Once he is successfully a alert will pop up notifying the chef the item is successfully added. The are validations associated with save button. All fields must be field and the price must be a valid number.

The information entered will be in the flatlist. It is located below the menu: 0. As soon the dish is entered in the flatlist, the number will increment and the display will be Menu: 1. When the dish is successfully entered, the number will keep on incrementing representing the number of dishes in the menu.
